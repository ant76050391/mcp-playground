This is a test document for ChromaDB integration validation.

The RAG MCP Server now supports persistent vector storage using ChromaDB, which provides:

1. Efficient vector similarity search with cosine similarity
2. Persistent storage with automatic content change detection  
3. Metadata management with file paths, types, and extraction information
4. Batch operations for optimal performance
5. Real-time updates when files are modified

This document should be automatically detected by the file monitor, extracted using the text extraction engine, embedded using the BGE-M3 Korean model, and stored in the ChromaDB vector store.

Keywords for testing: ChromaDB, vector search, embedding, similarity, persistence, RAG, MCP Server, Korean language processing, BGE-M3.

Testing search functionality with various Korean phrases:
- 안녕하세요 (Hello)  
- 벡터 검색 (Vector search)
- 데이터베이스 (Database)
- 자연어 처리 (Natural language processing)
- 기계학습 (Machine learning)
